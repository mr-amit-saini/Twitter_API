# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
- Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular use cases for NLP (Natural Language Processing).
- It refers to the use of NLP to determine the attitude, opinions and emotions of a speaker, writer, or other subject within an online mention.
- A common use for this technology comes from its deployment in the social media space to discover how people feel about certain topics, particularly through usersâ€™ word-of-mouth in textual posts, or in the context of Twitter, their tweets.
